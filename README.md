# Spectrum

We can use the README to discuss status.

So this is completely untested atm. I believe all the core funtionality is there so you can technically start running learning on it. Take a look at the big chunk of documentation I have at the top of the file for the procedure of running it (since it's multiagent + multistate, you have to do some stuff on your own end).

When I get time I'm going to write some sanity tests, make the action_space work so you can sample randomly, and then put in some helper functions that hopefully should make your lives easier. There's also a render method which I haven't dealt with yet, I might hack together a cmd line GUI.
